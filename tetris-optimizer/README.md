**TETRIS-OPTIMIZER**
This code represents a program for **placing tetrominoes on a game board**. Let's walk through it step by step.

The program starts by checking the number of command line arguments. If the number of arguments is not equal to 1, the program prints an error message and exits.
The program reads the contents of the file specified as a command line argument. If the file is not found, an error message is displayed, and the program exits. If the file is empty, a message indicating the absence of tetrominoes is printed, and the program exits.

The content of the file is split into lines and then into tetrominoes by calling the **functions.FindTetro(SplitContent)** function. After this, the minimum size of the game board required to accommodate all tetrominoes is determined.

A game board of the specified minimum size is created using the **functions.CreateBoard(minSize)** function. Then an attempt is made to place all tetrominoes on the board using the **functions.TryPosition(0, tetrominoesList, minSize)** function. If the placement of all tetrominoes is successful, the program prints the solution and exits.
